# Secure Banking System (C++ Project)

## Overview
This repository contains a Secure Banking System implemented in C++. It simulates a bank system with customer and admin functionalities, including user authentication, account management, and admin controls.

## Key Features
- **Customer Functions:**
  - User authentication with unique IDs and passwords.
  - Account management: view, update personal information, check balance, transfer money.
  - Password reset functionality.
  
- **Admin Functions:**
  - Verify new customer accounts.
  - Edit user information.
  - Accept or reject new account requests.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: Main source file containing program logic.
- `loginInfo.h`, `temp.h`, `customer.h`, `AdminInfo.h`: Header files for respective classes.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implemented classes (customer, AdminInfo, loginInfo) for encapsulation and modularity.
- **User Interface Design:** Interactive prompts for user input and validation.
- **Data Validation:** Ensured data integrity with input checks (age, Aadhar number, phone number).
- **File Structure Management:** Organized code into header files for improved readability and maintenance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable to simulate the Secure Banking System.
4. Follow on-screen prompts for customer login, admin login, or new customer signup.
